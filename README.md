This project was created for CS350 at SNHU

For this class I was tasked with creating a working thermostat with a CC3220S LaunchPad. 
This class proved to be a challange as I had to learn not only C but also how to create a program
with limited resources that microcontrollers provide. The resulting program was able to accuratly 
state the current temperature even second. As part of the project a section of the code is dedicated to
sending information to a server, even if one did not actually exist, and was merely text in nature.
